# 3D Shape Recognition Dataset

The data for this assignment is a modified version of the data available at: [ShapeNet](https://shapenet.org/)

**Licence agreement: The dataset can only be used for the purpose of this assignment. Sharing or distributing this data or using this data for any other commercial or non-commercial purposes is prohibited (including uploading the data to a public GitHub repository).**

The Dataset contaiimages from 20 different 3D shapes. There are 31530 training shapes in total with 4 2D views per shape.
             

## Files:
- `README.md`: Description of dataset.
    
- `data.zip`: Contain all the images that are to be used for model development.

- `data.csv`: Contain file names (for the 4 views) and the label of the 3D shape. This data is to be used in developing the models.

- `test_data.csv`: **Will be released later (one day prior to the due date)**. Contain file names (for the 4 views). You need to predict the class label for this data and submit the prediction via canvas. The teaching team will use this data to evaluate the performance of the model you have developed.

- `s1234567_predictions.csv`: **Will be released later (one day prior to the due date)**. Shows the expected format for your predictions on the unseen test data. You should organize your predictions in this format. Any deviation from this format will result on zero marks for the results part. Change the number in the filename to your student ID.
